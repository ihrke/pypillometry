Tutorials/Example Notebooks
---------------------------

These examples are available as executable Jupyter Notebooks from the `Github repository <https://github.com/ihrke/pypillometry/tree/master/docs>`_ (the files ending in `.ipynb`). The link to the notebook files is given at the end of each page.

Each Notebook comes with a link that looks like this:

When clicking on this link, the notebook will open in an interactive session in your browser without the need to install :py:mod:`pypillometry` at all.
