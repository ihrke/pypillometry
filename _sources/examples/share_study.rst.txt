Sharing/Importing study data from OSF
=====================================

`pypillometry` provides functionality to easily load a complete study from a local cache directory and a user-provided configuration file. That way, scripts can avoid to include lengthy code for parsing the raw data files. Once the configuation script is in place, the user can load the data as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import pypillometry as pp
    study,conf = pp.load_study_local(path="./data", config="pypillometry_conf.py")


share and import study data via the `Open Science Framework (OSF) <https://osf.io>`_. The :func:`~pypillometry.load_study_osf()` function allows you to easily download and load study data that has been shared on OSF.

Sharing Your Study
------------------

To share your study on OSF:

1. Create a new project on OSF
2. Upload your study data files and configuration file (``pypillometry_conf.py``) to the project
    - see 
3. Note down your project's OSF ID (found in the project URL)

The configuration file (``pypillometry_conf.py``) should define:

- ``raw_data``: Dictionary mapping subject IDs to their data files
- A ``read_subject()`` function that processes the raw data files

Loading Shared Data
-------------------

To load a shared study, use :func:`~pypillometry.io.load_study_osf()`:

.. code-block:: python

    from pypillometry.io import load_study_osf
    
    # Load all subjects
    study_data = load_study_osf(
        osf_id="your_project_id",
        path="local/cache/path"
    )
    
    # Load specific subjects
    study_data = load_study_osf(
        osf_id="your_project_id", 
        path="local/cache/path",
        subjects=["sub01", "sub02"]
    )

Parameters
----------

- ``osf_id`` (str): The OSF project ID
- ``path`` (str): Local path where files should be downloaded/stored
- ``subjects`` (list[str], optional): List of specific subject IDs to load
- ``force_download`` (bool, optional): Force re-download of files even if they exist locally

The function will:

1. Download the project's configuration file
2. Download the required data files for each subject
3. Process the data using the configuration's ``read_subject()`` function
4. Return a dictionary mapping subject IDs to their processed data

Files are cached locally in the specified path to avoid repeated downloads.

Example configuration file
--------------------------

Here is an example configuration file (``pypillometry_conf.py``) that could be used to share a study:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/pypillometry_conf.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:

This configuration file is a real study that was shared on OSF and you can download the corresponding data using the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    from pypillometry import load_study_osf
    study_data = load_study_osf("ca95r", path="./data")

The data will be downloaded and cached in the ``./data`` directory and `study_data` will be a dictionary mapping subject IDs to their data.
